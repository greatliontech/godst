# Issue docs

Tracked follow-ups and **pending features**. Each entry carries a `Lands:` trigger
(a chunk number, a condition, or "pending feature" for planned roadmap work). The
chunk-start gate (sub-chunk `N.1`) scans this index for entries resolving to the
current chunk; the close-out gate promotes any load-bearing rationale inline and
deletes the resolved entry.

## Open issues

| Issue | Lands | Summary |
|-------|-------|---------|
| [dst-hb-shadow-coverage](dst-hb-shadow-coverage.md) | when the dst-race HB recording paths (chan/select/atomic) are next modified | Channel/select/atomic HB records don't honor `raceignore` (mutex/RWMutex bridges do); contended-path mutex HB records lack event-stream enforcement. |

## Pending features

The I/O and fault features on the design.md Roadmap — planned work that brings real
I/O into the bubble and then layers fault injection on top.

| Feature | Order | Summary |
|---------|-------|---------|
| [dst-disk](dst-disk.md) | next | In-memory deterministic filesystem (os file ops, deterministic ReadDir order) so unmodified file-using code is reproducible. The base for disk faults (latency/EIO/ENOSPC/torn writes). |
| [dst-io](dst-io.md) | after disk | Deterministic file/pipe/stdio I/O for whatever network and disk don't cover (os.Pipe, std streams). |
